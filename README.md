Ensure the `config.yaml` file is present in the root directory with the following content:

```yaml
# Configuration for PDFExtractor

# Directories
input_dir: "path/to/your/pdf_folder"      # Replace with the path to your input PDF folder
output_dir: "path/to/output_folder"       # Replace with the path where you want to save the results

# API Configuration
api_keys_file: "api_keys.txt"             # Path to the file containing OpenAI API keys, one per line

# Crawler Settings
max_workers: 4                            # Number of threads for parallel processing
initial_dpi: 300                          # DPI for initial PDF to image conversion
retry_dpi: 200                            # DPI for retry attempts if initial conversion fails

# LLM (GPT-4) Configuration
llm:
  model: "gpt-4"                           # LLM model to use
  system_prompt: |

  - Ensure Tesseract is installed and the executable is in your system PATH.
  - If installed in a custom location, specify the path in `pdf_crawler.py` by uncommenting and setting the `tesseract_cmd` path:
    ```python
    # pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/usr/bin/tesseract'  # Example for Linux
    # pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'  # Example for Windows
    ```

- **OpenAI API Rate Limits**:
  - Ensure you have multiple API keys in `api_keys.txt` to rotate and handle rate limits.
  - Monitor your API usage in the OpenAI dashboard.

- **Insufficient OCR Output**:
  - Increase the DPI settings in `config.yaml` to enhance image quality.
  - Adjust OCR languages if processing multilingual PDFs.

- **Missing Dependencies**:
  - Ensure all packages are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - Verify that system dependencies like Poppler are installed for `pdf2image`.

- **Permission Errors**:
  - Ensure the script has read permissions for `input_dir` and write permissions for `output_dir` and logs.
